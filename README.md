# pop_projection

Projection of a population consisting of :
- workers (in a company)
- their conjoints
- thier children

Given such population at year 0, we compute, for each following year (year 1, year 2, ..., year 100, and at the end of that year), the number of individuals, that died, those that quit the company (workers)  and those that retired (workers). In addition to that, new children, new conjoints, and new workers.

The laws governing suchs movements are :
- law of mortality
- law of quitting
- law of retirement (this one is in fact deterministic : retirement at some age , 60 for example)
-
